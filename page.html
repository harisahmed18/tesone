        <textarea placeholder="" name="comment" id="" cols="130" rows="20"> Astrology is the study of the influence that distant cosmic objects, usually stars and planets, have on human lives. The position of the sun, stars, moon and planets at the time of people's birth (not their conception) is said to shape their personality, affect their romantic relationships and predict their economic fortunes, among other divinations.

            What most people know about astrology is their "sign," which refers to one of the 12 constellations of the zodiac. This is a form of sun-sign astrology, which is the astrology upon which newspaper horoscopes are based. It is probably the simplest form, because nothing more than the date of someone's birthday is needed to generate a sun-sign horoscope. Many astrologers will tell you that this form of astrology is so simplistic that it produces very limited results.

            Even within Western astrology, there is a considerable diversity of methods and philosophies. Some divide astrology by the end result that is intended:

             Mundane Astrology  - This is used to examine world events and make predictions about national affairs, wars and economies.
            Interrogatory Astrology - This branch can be further subdivided, but generally refers to astrology that seeks to make specific predictions or analyses about the subject's objectives or events within the subject's life.
            Natal Astrology - This is what most people think of when they think of astrology. Natal Astrology seeks to make predictions and analyses based on the date of a person's birth. It's based on the idea that everything that happens to something is expressed at the very beginning of that thing, sometimes known as the Law of Beginnings

<h2>Virgo ‚ôç </h2>
<p>Virgo, you should try to be tolerant of other people's social and political positions. You may have to deal with certain people whose personal plans are jeopardized by events beyond their control. Don't judge them. Don't immediately defend one viewpoint without thinking how the situation affects the other person's life.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2>
    Libra ‚ôé
</h2>

<p>
    The work you do is beginning to change in some fashion, Libra. The universe has big plans for this realm, but you need to make sure you‚Äôre solid in the vision you want to bring to life. The path-guiding sun‚Äôs square with visionary Jupiter highlights this story today. Meanwhile, the reflective Virgo moon‚Äôs dance with dreamy Neptune makes reality hard to discern from fantasy. Prioritize low-key restful alone time above all else.
</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2>
    Scorpio ‚ôè
</h2>

<p>Friday‚Äôs skies find you dreaming big, Scorpio. The moon marches through capable Virgo, pointing your attention towards your aspirations. Luna‚Äôs rendezvous with spacey Neptune adds hints of both inspiration and illusion to your creative process and romantic involvements. At the same time, the life-giving sun‚Äôs square with visionary Jupiter can make it easy to go overboard with any indulgences. Enjoy yourself but beware of over-extending financially!</p>
<br>

<h2>Sagittarius ‚ôê

</h2>
<p> 
    Relationship revelations are likely to emerge beneath Friday‚Äôs skies, Sagittarius. Your ruling planet, spiritual Jupiter, receives a difficult visit from the revealing sun. This pairing allows for some much needed course-correction, especially in terms of anything involving complex home or family dynamics. It‚Äôs imperative you begin building a more secure emotional foundation within yourself, so that your relationships can continue to successfully thrive.


</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2>
    Capricorn ‚ôë
</h2>
<p> 
    You‚Äôre hungry to learn new things, Capricorn. Yet, you can sometimes stand in your own way of doing that out of fear. The illuminating sun‚Äôs square with dream-big Jupiter today reminds you to stay optimistic and make room for new opportunities that boost your self-expression. Elsewhere, reality is hard to find and a longing for escape is strong, as the capable Virgo moon dances with dreamy Neptune.


</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>
    Aquarius  ‚ôí
</h2>
<p>
    It‚Äôs okay to hang back today, Aquarius. You‚Äôre not likely to be in the mood for any light, frivolous socializing‚Äîas the pensive Virgo moon makes you feel withdrawn and turns up your need for intimacy. Luna‚Äôs dance with reality-bending Neptune can make it hard to focus on things as it is, so let yourself rest. Elsewhere, the life-giving sun‚Äôs square with visionary Jupiter blurs the reality of your current finances. Beware of mindless splurging!


</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>
    Pisces ‚ôì
</h2>
<p>
    Pisces are very friendly, so they often find themselves in a company of very different people. Pisces are selfless, they are always willing to help others, without hoping to get anything back.

    Pisces is a Water sign and as such this zodiac sign is characterized by empathy and expressed emotional capacity.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>
    Aries ‚ôà
</h2>
<p>

    It‚Äôs easy to feel disoriented under Friday‚Äôs mystifying skies, Aries. The efficient Virgo moon pushes you to focus on incomplete tasks and projects, yet her dizzying opposition to sleepy Neptune makes it hard to stay out of fantasy land. At the same time, the path-lighting sun squares off with grandiose Jupiter, helping you make positive mental adjustments that start to bring your big plans to life.

    May 21, 2021 - Today could discourage even the most ardent of passions, Leo. Even if some people say you're a bit cold, know that there's a veritable volcano burning underneath all that ice. Today you may once again find yourself at a distance from your feelings, as if you were regaining control over your emotions. Be careful about being too cynical about things.
